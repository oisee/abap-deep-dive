#### Issue 2.2: Database Support in R/2
- **Location**: Line 28
- **Current**: "IMS/DB2/VSAM"

- **Source**: S/4HANA Finance documentation

#### Issue 4.3: Compatibility Views
- **Location**: Lines 501-502
- **Current**: Shows BKPF/BSEG as "Compatibility Views"
- **Correct**: These are CDS Views, not database views. Important distinction
- **Source**: S/4HANA Migration Guide

### 5. Performance Claims

#### Issue 5.1: Real-time Analytics

- **Current**: Lists only basic WP types
- **Correct**: Missing V2 update processes, should distinguish UPD and UP2
- **Source**: SAP Basis Administration Guide

#### Issue 6.2: Port Numbers
- **Location**: Throughout
- **Current**: No port numbers mentioned
- **Correct**: Should include standard SAP port numbers (32NN, 33NN, 36NN, etc.)
